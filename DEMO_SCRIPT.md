# Scalable cToken Demo Script

## Concise Demo Script (150 words)

"Today I'm showcasing Scalable cToken, a solution for distributing proof-of-participation tokens at scale using Solana Pay and Light Protocol's compression technology.

Our platform solves the challenge of efficiently distributing digital tokens to event attendees. Using ZK compression, we've achieved a 1000x reduction in storage costs and can mint up to 1,000 tokens per transaction.

For event organizers, the process is simple: connect your Solana wallet, create an event with custom details, and generate QR codes for distribution. The system handles token creation using Light Protocol's compression technology.

Attendees just scan the QR code with their phone, approve the claim in their Solana wallet, and instantly receive their token â€“ all with minimal fees.

The application demonstrates how ZK compression transforms token distribution, making it economically viable for events of any size while maintaining the security and composability benefits of standard Solana tokens.
