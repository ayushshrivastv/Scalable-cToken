# Token Creation Fixes

This document details the comprehensive fixes applied to resolve token creation issues with Light Protocol compressed tokens.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Admin Keypair Issues

**Problem:** The admin keypair wasn't being correctly parsed from the base64-encoded environment variable, or the keypair didn't have the proper permissions.

**Solution:**
- Improved the admin private key storage format in the `.env` file
- Added support for both base64 and comma-separated formats for backward compatibility
- Enhanced validation to verify the keypair is properly formatted before use
- Set the admin keypair as the mint authority when creating tokens

### 2. Insufficient Funds for Rent

**Problem:** The admin wallet didn't have enough SOL to cover the "rent" (storage costs) for creating new accounts on Solana.

**Solution:**
- Added an automatic balance check to ensure the admin wallet has at least 3 SOL
- Increased the rent calculation safety margin to 50% (1.5x) to ensure sufficient funds
- Added instructions for manual funding if automatic airdrops are unavailable

### 3. RPC Endpoint Limitations

**Problem:** The default Solana devnet RPC endpoint didn't support all methods required by Light Protocol.

**Solution:**
- Updated the RPC endpoint to use Helius with better support for Light Protocol methods
- Modified the token creation API to consistently use the improved RPC endpoint
- Enhanced error logging to capture detailed transaction failure information

### 4. Metadata URI Issues

**Problem:** Invalid metadata URIs (such as direct image links instead of JSON metadata) were causing transaction simulation failures.

**Solution:**
- Standardized metadata URI to use a known-good Arweave JSON metadata link
- Added input validation and trimming for token name and symbol
- Enforced proper metadata format validation

### 5. Transaction Priority Improvements

**Problem:** Token creation transactions were failing due to competition for block space.

**Solution:**
- Increased priority fees to 5000 micro-lamports per compute unit (up from 1000)
- Increased compute unit limit to 300,000 for complex transactions
- Improved transaction retry logic

## Implementation Details

### Environment Configuration

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLUSTER=devnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_ENDPOINT=https://rpc-devnet.helius.xyz/?api-key=1d8740dc-e5f4-421c-b823-e1bad1889eff
# Admin keypair stored in two formats for compatibility
# Base64 format (primary)
ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY=(base64-encoded-private-key)
```

### Admin Keypair Handling

```typescript
const privateKeyBuffer = Buffer.from(process.env.ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY || '', 'base64');
const adminKeypair = Keypair.fromSecretKey(privateKeyBuffer);
```

### Setting Correct Mint Authority

```typescript
const { mint, signature } = await createCompressedTokenMint(
  connection,
  adminKeypair,
  adminKeypair.publicKey, // Admin as mint authority
  decimals,
  tokenName,
  tokenSymbol,
  tokenMetadataUri
);
```

### Rent Calculation with Safety Margin

```typescript
const calculatedRentLamports = await connection.getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption(
  mintLen + metadataLen
);
const rentLamports = Math.ceil(calculatedRentLamports * 1.5); // 50% safety margin
```

### Using a Reliable RPC Endpoint

```typescript
const rpcEndpoint = 'https://rpc-devnet.helius.xyz/?api-key=1d8740dc-e5f4-421c-b823-e1bad1889eff';
const connection = createConnection({
  rpcEndpoint: rpcEndpoint,
  cluster: 'devnet'
});
```

### Enhanced Error Handling

```typescript
// More detailed error messages and logging
if (error instanceof Error) {
  errorDetails = error.message;
  // If the error object has more specific Solana transaction error details
  if ('transactionMessage' in error && (error as any).transactionMessage) {
    errorDetails = (error as any).transactionMessage;
  }
  if ('transactionLogs' in error && (error as any).transactionLogs) {
    console.error("Transaction Logs:", (error as any).transactionLogs);
  }
}
```

## Testing & Verification

To verify the fixes are working:

1. Check that the admin wallet has been funded with at least 3 SOL
2. Try creating a token through the application UI
3. Monitor the browser console and server logs for successful transactions
4. Verify the token appears in the user's wallet after creation

## Future Improvements

- Implement automatic retry logic for failed transactions
- Add client-side validation for token metadata format
- Create a dedicated admin wallet funding mechanism
- Add comprehensive error mapping for user-friendly messages
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Troubleshooting

If token creation still fails:

1. Check the admin wallet balance (should be at least 3 SOL)
2. Verify the RPC endpoint is responsive
3. Review browser console logs for detailed error information
4. Ensure metadata URI is properly formatted (JSON format, not direct image links)
5. Validate that the Light Protocol services are operational
