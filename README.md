# Scalable cToken (Solana Pay)

This project enables event organisers to mint digital POP tokens that can be claimed by attendees through a simple scan of a QR code. These tokens are not just symbolic; they represent verifiable, compressed assets living entirely on-chain, making them ideal for airdrops, community rewards, or credentialing at scale.

For a detailed technical architecture and component flow diagrams, please refer to the [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) document.

P.S. After 48 hours of coding, debugging, and more coffee than water—here’s the project. The backend isn’t quite where I want it yet—there’s still a lot of work ahead.

 I came across this project on Superteam on March 10th, and this is my first-ever submission—and also my first Solana project!

## Overview

Scalable cToken Distribution with Solana Pay and ZK Compression on Solana

A high throughput solution for creating and distributing compressed proof-of-participation tokens at scale on Solana blockchain using Solana Pay and Light Protocol's compression technology.

Check out [Presentation](./DEMO_SCRIPT.md) for a quick overview of the project's functionality.

## Solana Pay and Smart Contract Workflow

This Scalable cToken uses Solana Pay to make QR code interactions super easy. Attendees can claim tokens without any hassle. The organizers set up a smart contract on Solana to mint tokens. This contract uses Light Protocol’s infrastructure to create cTokens. When an attendee scans the Solana Pay QR code, it sends a transaction to the smart contract. The smart contract checks if the claim is valid and then sends a unique, compressed proof-of-participation token straight to the attendee’s wallet. This way, the tokens are distributed securely and efficiently.

## Functionality

Organisers can log in with their Solana wallet, create a new event, and instantly mint compressed tokens tied to event metadata such as name, time, and location. Upon creation, the system generates a Solana Pay-compatible QR code, which attendees can scan to securely claim their tokens via their own wallet. Each token is issued using Light Protocol's compression infrastructure, drastically reducing storage costs while maintaining full L1 composability.

The user interface is built to be intuitive across devices and accommodates both the event creator and attendee journeys—from minting to claiming—with minimal friction.

## QR Codes & Airdrops

### Solana Pay QR Codes
The application leverages Solana Pay's QR code technology to create a seamless claiming experience:

- **Dynamic Generation**: Each event automatically generates a unique QR code that encodes all necessary transaction data
- **Instant Recognition**: Compatible with any standard QR scanner or smartphone camera
- **Transaction Embedding**: QR codes contain pre-formatted transaction instructions for token claiming
- **Wallet Connectivity**: Scanning initiates an immediate connection to the user's preferred Solana wallet
- **Security Features**: Each QR code includes validation parameters to prevent unauthorized claims

### Airdrop Capabilities
The platform offers efficient airdrop functionality for event organizers:

- **Bulk Distribution**: Send tokens to multiple recipients simultaneously with minimal gas costs
- **Targeted Campaigns**: Create audience segments based on event participation or other criteria
- **Scheduled Releases**: Set up timed airdrops to coincide with event milestones
- **Claim Verification**: Monitor real-time claiming statistics through an intuitive dashboard
- **Flexible Allocation**: Distribute different quantities of tokens to different participant tiers

This combination of QR-based claiming and airdrop functionality makes the platform ideal for both in-person events and remote participation scenarios.

### Smart Contracts & Solana Pay Integration
Distribute tokens to large audiences with just a few clicks. Our airdrop system allows event organizers to send tokens to hundreds or thousands of attendees simultaneously. The platform leverages custom Solana smart contracts that interact seamlessly with Light Protocol's compression technology, reducing transaction costs by 1000x. Solana Pay integration enables frictionless claiming through scannable QR codes that embed transaction instructions, wallet connections, and verification parameters—all while maintaining sub-second finality and military-grade security.

## Setup & Installation

To run this project locally, ensure you have Node.js 16 or later and a compatible Solana wallet (Phantom, Backpack, or Solflare). Clone the repository and install dependencies using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayushshrivastv/Scalable-cToken.git
cd Scalable-cToken
npm install
```

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following environment variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLUSTER=devnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_ENDPOINT=https://api.devnet.solana.com
```

Then start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Connect your wallet to begin creating or claiming tokens.

## Using the Application

To create tokens, connect your wallet and navigate to the "Create Event" section. Fill out the event information, confirm the transaction, and a QR code will be generated for distribution. Attendees can scan this QR code using any QR reader or camera app, which will launch Solana Pay and guide them through the token claim process in a few simple steps.

The process is secure, affordable, and designed for high-volume usage at real-world events.

## Technical Stack

This application is built with Next.js 15, React 18, and TypeScript, using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for the frontend. Blockchain functionality is powered by Solana, with Light Protocol handling compression. Wallet interactions are handled via the Solana Wallet Adapter framework.

The architecture allows easy extensibility and is suitable for further enhancements such as event analytics, email confirmations, or token gating.
